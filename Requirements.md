# Requirements

## Expense Tracking
- Users can log expenses quickly (including fields like price, category, name, etc.). Should be very intuitive design for quick entry.
- Users can enter and edit their income to adjust their goals.
- Users can set budgets for daily/weekly/monthly. 
- Users should be able to see budget information with visual indicators (progress bars, charts, graphs, etc.). You should be able to see the status of your spending at a glance rather than having to read a bunch of numbers.
- Users can see historical spending trends. This can be displayed using a graph with varying levels of specificity (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). 

## Insights & Visualization
- Show expenses in simple, easy-to-read charts (pie, bar, timeline).
- Call out top spending categories and unusual spikes.
- Frame the data in a positive, motivating way (celebrate progress, not guilt).

## Notifications & Reminders
- Send customizable reminders to log expenses.
- Be able to give motivational quotes that help the user stay more consistent

## Streaks and Challenges
- Users can track streaks (consecutive days of logging expenses or income)
- Users receive daily/weekly challenges (ex. “Log all meals today” or “Spend under $20 on coffee this week”)
- Users can gain experience points when challenges are completed
- Users get achievements for hitting milestones (ex. 7-day streak) and gain points from milestones
- Users should be able to specify spending goals within a specified time period (day, week, month, etc.)
- The app should be able to compare the current time period to previous performances under the same time period
- The app should notify the user when they are close to reaching their specified goal or limit

## Gamification & UX

1. In order to have a more interactive feel, users shall earn XP and level up as they complete challenges, streaks, and goals 
2. The app shall have a visual feedback system (e.g., animations, confetti, progress rings) when users log actions or complete challenges to reward their efforts
3. The app shall offer unlockables or fun rewards (e.g., badges, mystery boxes, spin wheel). This could include having a place in the website that stores 
4. The system shall allow users to view their overall “financial health score” based on habits. This allows them to see the improvement they made and keep advancing .
