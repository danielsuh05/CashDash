# Requirements

## Expense Tracking
- Users can log expenses quickly (including fields like price, category, name, etc.). Should be very intuitive design for quick entry.
- Users can enter and edit their income to adjust their goals.
- Users can set budgets for daily/weekly/monthly. 
- Users should be able to see budget information with visual indicators (progress bars, charts, graphs, etc.). You should be able to see the status of your spending at a glance rather than having to read a bunch of numbers.
- Users can see historical spending trends. This can be displayed using a graph with varying levels of specificity (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). 

## Insights & Visualization
- Show expenses in simple, easy-to-read charts (pie, bar, timeline).
- Call out top spending categories and unusual spikes.
- Frame the data in a positive, motivating way (celebrate progress, not guilt).

## Notifications & Reminders
- Send customizable reminders to log expenses.
- Be able to give motivational quotes that help the user stay more consistent

## Streaks and Challenges
- Users can track streaks (consecutive days of logging expenses or income)
- Users receive daily/weekly challenges (ex. “Log all meals today” or “Spend under $20 on coffee this week”)
- Users can gain experience points when challenges are completed
- Users get achievements for hitting milestones (ex. 7-day streak) and gain points from milestones
- Users should be able to specify spending goals within a specified time period (day, week, month, etc.)
- The app should be able to compare the current time period to previous performances under the same time period
- The app should notify the user when they are close to reaching their specified goal or limit

## Gamification & UX

- In order to have a more interactive feel, users shall earn XP and level up as they complete challenges, streaks, and goals 

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Users must be able to input data and receive a response quickly
2. The app must be accessible: color contrast, sizing, etc.
3. The app must render dashboards within 1 second for a typical dataset

## Future Features
- Users can compete against other users. There will be a leaderboard listing who spent the least so that you can compete with others. 
- Users can share their goals with others so you can see how your friends/family are doing with their goals. 
- Users can link with their bank for automatic expense importing. This way they don't have to log it right after.
