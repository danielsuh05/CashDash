## Story 1
Hi, my name is Jared. Jared McCain. I want to use Cash Dash because ever since I got into the NBA, I’ve been spending way too much money without even realizing it. Been spending a lot of money on shoes, clothes and dinners, and it feels like it has all been adding up. With Cash Dash, I can quickly log my expenses after every purchase, keep track of my streaks, and actually see where my money is going. It feels more fun and gamified which makes things less daunting for me. I like that I can set goals so I don’t overspend each month, and the ghost competition lets me see if I’m doing better than “last month Jared.” It makes money management less stressful and actually a little fun.

## Story 2
Daniel is a middle-aged man with a wife and two kids under 10 years old. He has slowly climbed up the ranks in his tech company and earns a modest salary from them. However, he has an addiction to buying Pokémon cards. In fact, he consistently spends the majority of his salary on them without a second thought. Over time, he realizes that if he continues this lifestyle, he won’t have enough money to retire at 65 while also supporting his family, especially when his children enter college. Daniel knows it is time to start spending less on this addiction, but he needs to find a way to track it, as he easily forgets how much he spends. However, he does not want a boring budget tracker as he feels there is not much incentive to keep updating it, and instead wants a gamified version where he will feel rewarded every time he keeps track of his budget. 

## Story 3
My name is Kaden and I like video games. I want to earn XP for completing daily challenges, so that I feel rewarded for maintaining good financial habits. I want there to be daily challenges that are presented in a clear way, and when I complete them, it will reward me with some point system and give me visual feedback. This way I can get small wins every day and then I can check how much money I’ve saved from all of these small wins. 

## Story 4
Emily is a 26-year-old entrepreneur who launched her online wellness brand during COVID. What began as a small side hustle quickly grew into a thriving business, now generating over $1 million in annual revenue. While her professional life is flourishing, Emily’s personal finances tell a different story.

With money flowing in more easily than she ever imagined, Emily has slipped into carefree spending habits: luxury vacations, spontaneous shopping sprees, dining out almost every night, and investing in “fun” projects without research. She rarely tracks her expenses and assumes that as long as her business keeps growing, her lifestyle is sustainable.

But Emily is beginning to feel the weight of financial uncertainty. She notices her savings account isn’t growing, unexpected tax bills catch her off guard, and she struggles to understand where all her money is actually going. Despite her success, she often feels stressed when friends talk about investments, retirement accounts, or long-term planning — areas she knows she’s neglecting.

Emily doesn’t want to give up her lifestyle, but she does want balance, clarity, and control. She needs a tool that can do what CashDash does!!!!

## Story 5
Sarah is a waitress and works varying hours where pay often fluctuates. She also has a bit of a shopping addiction, and spends money almost as quickly as she makes it. Because of this, her finances are a mess, savings are none-existent, and future earnings are uncertain. Sometimes, she even overdrafts to fuel her habits. This lifestyle is characteristic of her overall personality: someone who lives life on the go, has trouble thinking long-term, and is easily distracted/bored (probably has ADHD).  She’s looked for services before to help manage her finances, but because of her personality and lifestyle, she can’t find anything engaging that fits her needs and enforces consistency, reverting back to her old ways where financial management is just another word.

CashDash could help solve Sarah’s financial issues. As a waitress with varying paychecks, CashDash would allow her to easily log her income with each paycheck and track spending. As someone who needs constant encouragement, reminders, and engagement, CashDash's unique and gamified features provide the exact type of user experience that will allow her to stick with her financial management journey and meet her outlined goals. 


## Story 6
John is a third year student in university that decided to study abroad in Madrid for the fall semester. While abroad, he got a notification from his bank that he had spent too much money in the process of booking flights and accommodations for weekend trips. On top of the expensive school tuition, the expenses from living abroad were proving to be too much for his budget. After a few weeks, John realized that he cannot afford to go on any more trips. John came to the conclusion that a leading problem which contributed to his expedited cash burn was his fear of confronting his spending habits. Instead of responsibly checking his account balance, he would avoid looking at his financial statements knowing that he would be disappointed in the results. What John could have benefited from was a system that displayed his financial information in a way that didn't make him feel bad. If John had an app like Cash Dash, he could meet goals he set out for himself, keep budgeting streaks, and ultimately have a better study abroad experience.

## Story 7

Aiden is a 30-year-old investment banker. He works long hours and rarely has time to manage his own finances. By the time he gets home, he’s too exhausted to track expenses or update spreadsheets, even though he knows he overspends on takeout and subscriptions.
