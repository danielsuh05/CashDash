## Story 4
My name is Kaden and I like video games. I want to earn XP for completing daily challenges, so that I feel rewarded for maintaining good financial habits. I want there to be daily challenges that are presented in a clear way, and when I complete them, it will reward me with some point system and give me visual feedback.

## Story 5
Emily is a 26-year-old entrepreneur who launched her online wellness brand during COVID. What began as a small side hustle quickly grew into a thriving business, now generating over $1 million in annual revenue. While her professional life is flourishing, Emily’s personal finances tell a different story.

With money flowing in more easily than she ever imagined, Emily has slipped into carefree spending habits: luxury vacations, spontaneous shopping sprees, dining out almost every night, and investing in “fun” projects without research. She rarely tracks her expenses and assumes that as long as her business keeps growing, her lifestyle is sustainable.

But Emily is beginning to feel the weight of financial uncertainty. She notices her savings account isn’t growing, unexpected tax bills catch her off guard, and she struggles to understand where all her money is actually going. Despite her success, she often feels stressed when friends talk about investments, retirement accounts, or long-term planning — areas she knows she’s neglecting.

Emily doesn’t want to give up her lifestyle, but she does want balance, clarity, and control. She needs a tool that can do what CashDash does!!!!
